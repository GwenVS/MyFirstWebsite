        <h2>Swimming pool</h2>

        <p>
            At our family beach hotel here are three spacious outdoor swimming pools with separate children’s pool and a
            pool with water slides. Umbrellas, sun beds and beach towels are available free of charge.
            In addition, there is an indoor pool in the hotel’s wellness center.
            There is normally a Life Guard around the pool areas, however, please note that the hotel gives a sign with
            a flag when the Life Guard is not on duty.
            Parents are kindly requested to take care of their children when using the swimming pools.

        <h2>Wellness Center</h2>

        <p>
            Holidays are synonymous with rest and relaxation and the ideal place to experience these qualities is a spa
            resort.
            To really wash away the stress and strains of your daily life, why not explore Lindos Princess Wellness
            Center?
            In our spa resort you can choose from a number of spa treatments; skilled therapists will refresh your mind,
            body and spirit for a perfect pampering.
            Spoil yourself with free use of sauna, Jacuzzi and Hamam or with a dive into our heated indoor swimming pool
            with fresh water leaving you glowing inside out

            Lindos Princess as a genuine spa all inclusive resort wouldn't dissatisfy the exercise fans.
            If you are one of those daily holiday work-out enthusiasts or just want some exercise to add up for all
            those servings in the Snack Bar,
            you don’t have to leave our grounds for a gentle, or not so gentle, exercise. Leander Fitness Center is
            located at the Ground Floor.
            The gym is fully equipped and is a part of the all- inclusive system. For safety reasons, children under 15
            years old are not allowed entrance.
